# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will do game dev for at least an hour every day for the foreseeable future.  This includes coding and Unity game development activities.*

## Start Date
23 Aug 2019

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at my day job, that time won't count towards the challenge, only my game dev time.
3. If my code is public, I will push code to GitHub so anyone can see my progress.
4. If my code is private, I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress.
5. I will work on real projects. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
